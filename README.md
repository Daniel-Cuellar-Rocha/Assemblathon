Assemblathon
============

This is a repository of code that was used in the Assemblathon 1 and 2 projects. Much of this code was used to 
generate specific datasets arising from the Assemblathon project, but the assemblathon_stats.pl script
may still be useful to others.

Useful links:

+ [Assemblathon website](http://assemblathon.org)
+ [Assemlbathon 1 paper](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/12/2224)
+ [Assemblathon 2 paper](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/2/1/10)

Note that there is [another version of this repository](https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics/assemblathon2-analysis) 
that contains the versions of code used at the time the Assemblathon 2 paper was published. That repository is no longer
being updated, but I will continue to update this one if there are any changes that need to be made to assemblatho_stats.pl
